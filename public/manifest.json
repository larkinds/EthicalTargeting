  "description": "Most data collection of Internet user behavior ultimately comes from advertising's desire for **audience targeting and campaign analytics**. Constant expos√©s in the news and the gradual rollout of data privacy regulations are not enough to fight this **technological arms race**. Pandora's box has been opened and advertisers will not back down from having access to targeting and analytics. Ethical Targeting recognizes this reality and compromises by **moving ad targeting to the browser**. Browsers pull from a public ledger of ads and match ads with locally stored user profiles that **never touch the Internet**. ",
